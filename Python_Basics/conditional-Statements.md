# Python Conditional Statements

## What are Conditional Statements?

Conditional statements in Python are used to make decisions in a program.

They allow the program to execute certain blocks of code only when specific conditions are met.

## Why We Need Conditional Statements?

In real life, we make decisions based on conditions.

Example:

- If it is raining → take an umbrella  
- If marks are above 40 → pass  
- If balance is low → recharge  

Similarly, in programming we need logic to take decisions.

## Conditional Statements in Python

Python provides the following conditional statements:

- if  
- if-else  
- if-elif-else  
- nested if  

These statements help in controlling the flow of a program based on conditions.
